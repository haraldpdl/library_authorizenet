<h1>Server Integration Method (SIM) <small>v2.0<br />for osCommerce Online Merchant v2.3</small></h1>

<p>Server Integration Method (SIM) provides a customizable, secure hosted payment form to make integration easy for Web merchants that do not have an SSL certificate, and uses scripting techniques to authenticate transactions with a unique transaction fingerprint.</p>

<p>The Authorize.Net Payment Gateway can handle all the steps in the secure transaction process - payment data collection, data submission and the response to the customer - while keeping Authorize.Net virtually transparent.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Payment gateway hosted payment form employs 128-bit SSL data encryption.</li>
  <li>Digital fingerprints enhance security, providing multiple layers of authentication.</li>
  <li>Customize the look and feel of the payment gateway hosted payment form and/or receipt page.</li>
</ul>
