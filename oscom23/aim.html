<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>SSL Certificate Verified Transactions</h3>

<p>All secured API transaction calls sent to Authorize.net are performed by verifying Authorize.net's SSL certificates to guarantee the identity of Authorize.net. This is performed by using the following public keys in order if they are available:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ext/modules/payment/authorizenet/authorize.net.crt</li>
  <li>includes/cacert.pem (public key bundle)</li>
  <li>the web server configured public key bundle</li>
</ul>

<p>A test connection link is available on the payment module configuration page which can be used to test if API transaction calls to Authorize.net can be verified from your web server. If the test connection fails, please contact your hosting provider as they may need to update your web server configuration. The SSL certificate verification can also be disabled on the payment module configuration page however it is highly discouraged to disable.</p>

<div class="alert">Some web hosting providers require a curl proxy to be used which can be configured on the payment module configuration page.</div>

  <li>ext/modules/payment/authorizenet/authorize.net.crt</li>
  <li>includes/languages/english/modules/payment/authorizenet_cc_aim.php</li>
